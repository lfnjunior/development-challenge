## Quick Start

Into 'Client React Redux' folder, you will need run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```
then

```
$ npm run dev
```

## API Rest AWS

Inside the folder API Rest AWS are the serverless scripts that I used to create the Rest API.
But the frontend already contains the Rest API endpoint
